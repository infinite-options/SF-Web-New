Create a new folder called component
everything in Nav.jsx, put them into component folder
create a folder for each component.
Each folder contain a jsx file.


Some a small components use repeatedly, also need a 
folder for future access. For example navBar. 

For example, on "/" page can be split into

1: home folder for home page itself
2: LandingNavBar
3: DeliveryLocationSearch
4: ProductDisplay 
5: Farmers
6: Testimonial
7: Order

Make 7 folders under /src/component folder. 

I think /Auth folder contain too many function
Each component can move to its own folder.
